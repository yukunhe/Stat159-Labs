### Introduction
This lab is to use ShinyDoc to plot scatter plots of sales vs different advertising channels. The data comes from Advertising.csv. 
The ShinyDoc has a dropdown with a list of 3 options - TV, Radio and Newspaper as an input element. 
The output is a scatter plot between sales and the input option with a fitted regression line.

### Structure
The lab8 folder consists of the following files:
Advertising.csv, app.R, and README.md.
The Advertising.csv provides the data set we use in the ShinyDoc. The app.R contains code for the ShinyDoc to provide scatter plots.
